    "Your constant fighting against the forces of the Oberon Confederation is draining on both of us. Perhaps we could put aside our enmity and work together for mutual gain?",
    "We can offer you contracts that match our rivals. Please take up this contract and let us work together.",
    "Commander, you have defeated us in combat before, so we know you are a competent mercenary unit. Please take this contract on and let us work together rather than against each other.",
    "The legitimate government of the Oberon Confederation has a contract for a mercenary group of your caliber, if you are interested.",
    "You fight well, Commander, and we've both benefited from our relationship in the past. I have another contract for you, the loot from which will benefit us both.",
    "Ahoy, Commander, it's good to see you again. I've got another job for you, one where a good bit of loot is to be had.",
    "Ahoy Matey! It's good to see you again, and I have a really juicy job for you with plenty of loot to be had!"

    "Well done, Matey! You finished off that contract easily, and your share of the loot, err, I mean payment, is already in your account."

    "You'd never make it in the Oberon Confederation with that sort of cowardly attitude! I'll partially pay you this time, but complete the damn contract next time, or else!"

    "I should cut out your heart and enslave your entire crew for failing this simple task. Leave before I decide to do it!"
