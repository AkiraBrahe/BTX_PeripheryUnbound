    "What is it that you have against our glorious empire? Before I unleash the full might of the Legions against you, I offer one last opportunity to work for us. Your choice.",
    "Instead of fighting the might of the Hegemony, would it not be more profitable to fight on the side of Caesar's Legions? I have a contract for you if you are interested.",
    "Commander, you have fought the Legions before and acquitted yourself well. Rather than face the might of the Hegemony again, perhaps you would prefer to take up this task?",
    "Greetings, Commander. Our Legions are occupied at the moment, and as a result, I have a task you can perform for the Hegemony.",
    "Hello again, Commander. We appreciate your past assistance, and I am authorized to offer you another contract.",
    "Hail Commander. You have proved quite useful to the Marian Hegemony, and I have saved this contract as reward for your services.",
    "Hail Commander. If all our Legions were as effective as you, we would have an empire to match any of the Successor Houses. I have this contract that I would entrust to no other, for your consideration."
