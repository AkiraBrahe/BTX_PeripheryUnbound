  "ShortName": "the Hegemony",
  "Description": "The Marian Hegemony is a major Periphery state rimward and anti-spinward of Terra. The Hegemony models itself on the ancient Terran Roman Empire, an absolute monarchy, ruled by an Imperator and later a Caesar. The society is heavily caste based, it is also one of the largest Periphery nation to practice slavery, and openly condones it. Most slaves are prisoners of war, however, as it is forbidden to buy or sell a citizen of the Hegemony. While trade flows between the Hegemony and the Free World League, Marian raids have kept relationships chilly. The Marian Hegemony has almost no good relations with the other Periphery nations. The only Periphery nation to have any good relations with the Hegemony is the Circinus Federation, primarily due to their mutual dislike of the Illyrian Palatinate.",

    "Commander, you have fought the Legions before and acquitted yourself well. Rather than face the might of the Hegemony again, perhaps you would prefer to take up this task?",
    "Greetings, Commander. Our Legions are occupied at the moment, and as a result, I have a task you can perform for the Hegemony.",
    "Hello again, Commander. We appreciate your past assistance, and I am authorized to offer you another contract.",
    "Hail Commander. You have proved quite useful to the Marian Hegemony, and I have saved this contract as reward for your services.",
    "Hail Commander. If all our Legions were as effective as you, we would have an empire to match any of the Successor Houses. I have this contract that I would entrust to no other, for your consideration."
