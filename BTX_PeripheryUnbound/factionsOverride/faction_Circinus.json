  "ShortName": "Circinus",
  "Description": "The Circinus Federation is a minor Periphery state nestled anti-spinward of the Lyran Commonwealth/Free Worlds League border. Founded in 2770 by fleeing Marik mercenaries and later joined by Lyran survivors of the Amaris Crisis in 2785, the Federation has evolved into a unique society. Settlers turned farmers form the backbone of the economy, providing stability and the illusion of a respectable agrarian nation. However, the true power lies with the Black Warriors, a feared mercenary band who serve as the Federation's military. While President McIntyre, the current ruler, maintains a fragile peace with the Commonwealth and Free Worlds League through a series of reconciliation treaties, the Black Warriors' allegiance is divided. Some pledge loyalty to the President, while others remain loyal to the Cirion family, the traditional leaders of the Black Warriors. This internal tension often leads to piracy and raids, straining relations with neighboring powers.",

    "You fight well, Commander, and we've both benefited from our relationship in the past. I have another contract for you, which will benefit us both.",
    "Ahoy, Commander, It's good to see you. I've got another job for you, one where a good bit of loot, err, I mean profit, can be had.",
