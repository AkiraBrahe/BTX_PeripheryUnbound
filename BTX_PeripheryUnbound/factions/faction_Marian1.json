    "Commander, you have fought the Legions before and acquitted yourself well. Rather than face the might of the Hegemony again, perhaps you would prefer to take up this task?",

    "Hail Commander. You have proved quite useful to the Marian Hegemony, and I have saved this contract as reward for your services.",
